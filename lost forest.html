                    <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>
                    <p>The Lost Woods is in the Great Hyrule Forest Region. You'll need to pass through the Lost Woods in order to make it to Korok Forest, an important hub in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that hosts access to five shrines, the Great Deku Tree, Master Sword, and Hestu, who increases your inventory</p>
                    
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT ?</strong></p>
                    <p>The Lost Woods is within the Woodland Tower region, which is directly north of Hyrule Castle, or alternatively, north of Lanayru Wetlands (which itself is north of Kakariko Village). It's not essential, we recommend activating the Woodland Tower to help flesh out your map and guide you for where you need to go</p>
