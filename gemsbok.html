                  <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                  <p>The gemsbok, gemsbuck or South African oryx (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. It is native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, such as the Kalahari Desert. Some authorities formerly included the East African oryx as a subspecies.</p>

                  <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT ?</strong></p>
                  <p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,[3] where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.[1] In the town of Oranjemund, gemsbok wander freely around the streets, taking advantage of the vegetation in the town, such as grass in the parks and the many trees.</p>
